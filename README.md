# E-Commerce-Clothing-Website

### This project represents an E-Commerce Clothing Website which has the next functionalities: sign up/login, add to favorites, sort by price, add to cart. The user can view the website, but in order to buy clothing they need to create an account.

### I used the following technologies for frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and for backend: PHP, SQL for managing the database where the user data and products are stored.
